## Procurement options overview

Generally speaking, there are two ways that 18F can work with a partner on a procurement - an Acquisition Consulting Engagement and an Assisted Acquisition.

### Acquisition Consulting Engagement

On an Acquisition Consulting engagement, the partner uses a contracting vehicle that they control and have access to at their agency to support the procurement. The contracting lead on the 18F team will work closely with the partner's contracting office to set up the procurement, develop soliciting materials, engage vendors and run through the mechanics of the procurement. 

The partner's contracting office takes the lead on these activities, and the contracting lead on the 18F team may pull in other team members at various times to review draft solicitation materials, to help evaluate written responses to the solicitation, to help screen vendors, and for various other purposes. The partner's contracting office will be the primary point of contact for the vendor for things like invoicing, time tracking, personnel changes and other contract questions.


### Assisted Acquisition 

On an Assisted Acquisition engagement, the partner will use a GSA/FAS procurement vehicle to support the procurement. The contracting lead on the 18F team will take the lead on setting up the procurement, developing soliciting materials, helping to identify potential vendors, and will work closely with others at GSA/FAS to run through the mechanics of the procurement. 

Compared to an Acquisition Consulting engagement, the 18F contracting lead and project lead will take a much more active role in setting up and running the procurement, and in managing the selected vendor after an award has been made. 

### All Acquisition Engagements

There are a number of activities that are common on all types of acquisition engagements that involve the entire 18F team. These activities are similar to those that are undertaken on any kind of 18F engagement:

* Conducting user research
* Developing prototypes, wireframes, and proofs of concept
* Setting up an integration and deployment pipeline to accept work delivered by a vendor
* Helping to identify key personnel at the partner agency who can work with the selected vendor

The goal of an 18F team on any acquisition engagement is to help our partners become more effective in selecting and managing vendors through the use of user research, human-centered design, agile, DevSecOps and product thinking. Like any engagement, our goal is to obviate the need for long-term 18F support by training our partners on the use of these key tactics in engaging with the vendor community.
