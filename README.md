# Path Analysis Resources

So you've been assigned to work on a path analysis. Congratulations! These short, eight-week projects are designed to better define a partner's problem, understand the current state, and come up with a path forward. They're different from projects where we're trying to figure out _how_ to build a thing. The purpose of a path analysis is to answer _what's going on_ and _what should the partner do next_.

We've written up specifics on [how to run a path analysis](https://github.com/18F/path-analysis/blob/master/approach.md).

Check out the [previous path analysis projects](https://github.com/18F/path-analysis/blob/master/projects.md).

## Templates

_These templates are internal tools, and access is limited to 18F staff._

- If the primary goal of your Path Analysis is to help partners address a specific problem, you may prefer to use [Path Analysis Report Template 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DBgwnnHuvR2fAojOwjP8gZ3_jA9pEAGRRKOnmH69d0s/) (make a copy first!). This is a flexible template, with space for findings and recommendations.
- If the primary goal is to deliver a complete, holistic strategy to address a broader need, this template may be a better fit: [Path Analysis Report Template 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mohw86sAoNrwZ6MnIMlX8420IkFWV2kPkB4a_XwbCm8/) (make a copy first!) This template uses an Objectives and Key Results (OKR) structure to emphasize high-level strategic objectives and key success metrics while complementing them with lower-level tactical activities. It also organizes findings into higher-level and lower-level findings.
