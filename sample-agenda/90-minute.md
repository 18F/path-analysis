# Sample 90-minute kickoff meeting agenda

- (10 min) __Introductions__ -- who are you and what are your expectations for the project; what is 18F and who is on the team
- (10 min) __Project history__ -- project sponsor explains how we got to where we are
- (10 min) __Project brief__ -- review the project brief and edit as necessary so that everyone in attendance agrees on what problem weâ€™re trying to solve
- (20 min) __Approach__ -- 18F reviews the approach based on our understanding of the project including specific tasks and timing. The group should reach consensus on this approach before adjourning. Identify dependencies and assign to-dos. 
- (15 min) __Interviews__ -- Confirm which stakeholders/user types need to be interviewed; identify who (18F or agency) will be contacting them, on what timetable, and scheduling them. Be prepared with wording for the interview request if the agency partner is sending it out. 
- (15 min) __Expectations__ -- Identify any expectations around deliverables: what are they, how will they be reviewed, how will they be shared with the larger organization
- (5 min) __Next step__ -- Agree on how often the 18F team will check in with the project sponsor (e.g., weekly) and interact with the core team. Decide on when the team will meet next.
